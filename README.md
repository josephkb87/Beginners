Rust is a challenging choice, but worth to be chosen. It has strong memory-safety and type-safety, this gives you no bother about those errors. However, static typing languages often slow our developing speed down in early stage 
This Rust Beginners repository does not teach programming, nor even to teach Rust Pogramming.

# Rust Beginners

_Beginners_, is a repository for Beginners that covers Beginners Basics of [Rust](#)

Rust is a general-purpose programming language emphasizing performance, type safety, and concurrency. It enforces memory safety, meaning that all references point to valid memory, without a garbage collector. To simultaneously enforce memory safety and prevent data races, its "borrow checker" tracks the object lifetime of all references in a program during compiling.


Great care has been taken to understand that while [Basel](#) and [Other Contributors](##) has been utilised to build this [Rust Beginners](#).

_Why_

Alot of the changes in programming language usage come with the need to learn new languages depending on industry and individuals requirements.
This repository serves the purpose of covering the basics for Beginners of Rust.

Rust is a challenging choice, but worth to be chosen. It has strong memory-safety and type-safety, this gives you no bother about those errors. However, static typing languages often slow our developing speed down in early stage 
This Rust Beginners repository does not teach programming, nor even to teach Rust Pogramming. 
Rather, it is intended to serve as a guide to provide a gentle introduction to Rust for someone who has or doesnot have experience with at least one other language, preferably a functional language.
