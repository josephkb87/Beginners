<<<<<<< HEAD

RustWebApp is A cross-platform desktop app made desktop using Rust, SolidJS, and Tauri.

_Tauri_

Tauri offers the ability to design your UI using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript but allows you to use lower-level languages to write the application and backend logic. Tauri primarily supports Rust as the backend language, but its API can be implemented across multiple languages

_Rust_
Rust as the backend.
Rust is a general-purpose programming language emphasizing performance, type safety, and concurrency. It enforces memory safety, meaning that all references point to valid memory, without a garbage collector. To simultaneously enforce memory safety and prevent data races, its "borrow checker"(we will see why this is important later) tracks the object lifetime of all references in a program during compiling.

### Rust
Rust as the backend is better for safety, speed, and preventing incorrect/unsafe code due to its statically-typed features and is great at preventing data races that can lead to undefined behavior, whereas C++ cannot do this work for you and opens up vulnerabilities.

### SolidJS
Contrary to the idea that using the main DOM slows down an application, it is part of what makes SolidJS so performant.The virtual DOM is a lightweight implementation of the main DOM.The way Solid achieves such performant speeds without the use of a virtual DOM is to compile its templates down to real DOM nodes and wrap updates in fine-grained reactions. This way, when your state updates, only the code that depends on it runs.
