_RustWebApp_
<<<<<<< HEAD

RustWebApp is A cross-platform desktop app made desktop using Rust, SolidJS, and Tauri.

_Tauri_

Tauri offers the ability to design your UI using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript but allows you to use lower-level languages to write the application and backend logic. Tauri primarily supports Rust as the backend language, but its API can be implemented across multiple languages

_Rust_
Rust as the backend.
Rust is a general-purpose programming language emphasizing performance, type safety, and concurrency. It enforces memory safety, meaning that all references point to valid memory, without a garbage collector. To simultaneously enforce memory safety and prevent data races, its "borrow checker"(we will see why this is important later) tracks the object lifetime of all references in a program during compiling.

_SolidJS_

SolidJS has one of the really good declarative UI Libraries.SolidJS a very powerful but not that well-known Javascript library that we can use to create modern and performing UI/UX.
